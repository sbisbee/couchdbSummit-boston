== Branding / What is Couch?

  - Replicator, HTTP, and JSON are key
  - couchapp/peer-2-peer vs bigdata => similarity is that it's a database
  - "CouchDB is a database"
  - The "DB" stands for "douche bag"
  - Don't future sell. We're smart, but experts - non experts will run away
    when they see what they have to do. There is a lot we can do very well now.
  - SLEEP (synchronizing event emitting persistence?) => RFC TIME!!

*The Result*

  - Optimize web site for personas
  - synchable.org describes SLEEP
  - It's a database! With outlets! (for modules like SLEEP)

== Code Contribution Flow

  - Copy jQuery's flow
    - Contribution guide
    - Team that's dedicated to this (pedantic with people skills)
    - Associated ticket and unit test(s)
  - Internally we need to read past white space issues and comment on what the
    patch is actually for/about.
  - Patches are languishing in JIRA => need to chop off the head or merge them
  - We need a place for people to do "crazy shit" (plugins?) that would not be
    merged into core
  - What is the tooling?
    - "No one gets hired for their JIRA contributions." (re: github)
    - We should mirror github and JIRA via a script (???)
    - Is there a linting tool for erlang?
  - Need to give feedback to contributors much more quickly (no more
    languishing)
  - Tooling is important, but we need to react
  - If someone is vetting tickets and they don't have the required knowledge to
    +1 a ticket, how do they pull people in for consent?

*The Result*

  - We need a consensus.
  - Figure out how to use our tools.
  - Need a team to set up the guidelines and work flow. They will be
    responsible for it.
