Teams
-----

  - Prevent bad bus factors.

  - Create a sense of ownership and therefore accountability.

  - Don't want to create a bunch of red tape, but the PMC needs to be able to
    ask teams for a status that can be copy/pasted into ASF board reports.

  - Each team would have a single point of contact that would track state,
    speak for the team, etc.

  - Hopefully it raises interest from additional contributors.

  - Some concern around everyone being on every team, whether it actually
    works, etc. FOSS being "worse than herding cats." Additionally there is a
    small group of people who took the time to learn all the dark corners of
    CouchDB.

  - Teams are volunteer based. If Paul (being picked on since he isn't here at
    the moment) doesn't want to join a team then he doesn't have to.

  - Teams will not be held to dates, but if they show a pattern of not
    delivering then they can be dropped by the PMC. But this is all worse case
    scenario.

  - Teams: [get list from Jan]

  - You don't get extra karma/power/say by being on a team.

  - Paul Davis, who is still not here, is nominated to write all of the
    documentation.

  - The main focus of teams is to yell at people. Ex., the docs team is
    responsible for making sure that someone who is pushing a feature provides
    documentation, or an explanation to the docs team so that they can write
    the documentation.

  - Instead of teams we could call them lounges. The points of contact could be
    concierges.

  - Concern is raised around creating red tape for no reason. That people can
    just go in and work on certain areas currently.

    - Counter concern is raised that that happens with a few people, but
      largely that people just talk and don't implement (bike shedding).

    - We need to make sure that these teams are transparent.

  - Need to increase transparency by using e-mail (mailing lists) more instead
    of IRC.

  - Concierge is becoming the preferred term. They enable and softly guide, but
    do not have authority.

  - Not all of the teams will be created today. They can be rolled out.

  - The project does not currently support focused discussion. For example,
    focused mailing lists.

**The Results**

  - Everyone agrees with the general sentiment.

  - No implementation details.
