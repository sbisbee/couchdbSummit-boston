Enabling the Community
----------------------

Scope: There are tooling issues where people don't know what to use, what's
well supported, etc. Part of the problem is that we don't have answers. Ex.,
the preferred library for Node.JS or update/dev design docs.

  - Too many things to try are out there.
  - Can we have preferred libraries?
  - Should we write our own?
  - Test server to write your code against.
  - npm for couchdb?
  - We've been trying to let the community drive the direction, but it hasn't
    worked. Is this a flaw or a lack of support/tooling?
  - One problem with an API spec is that people who do dirty things might still
    pass (ex., ORMs or libraries that kick off N+2 requests when N are needed).
  - CouchDB is easy to use, which means that everyone can write an API. There's
    a lot of crap out there as a result.
  - The problem is not which library to use, it's the onboarding. Maybe the
    intro tutorials uses the "easiest" to use?
  - Consolidate the portals? kanso, couchapp, relaxtv, etc.
  - Break out the users' skill levels and give them different documentation and
    recommendations.
  - Make sure CouchDB isn't seen as being evil when recommending things.
    (perception)
  - Guide to ramp up onto CouchDB that includes adaptive examples per language.

**The Results**

  - We need to develop the on ramp. Ex., three tiers.
